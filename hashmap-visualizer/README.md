# Engineer Lab

An interactive platform built with React and TypeScript for visualizing engineering concepts and data structures.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: See how engineering concepts work in real-time
- **Educational Demonstrations**:
  - Data structures (HashMap, arrays, trees, etc.)
  - Algorithm visualizations
  - Engineering concept simulations
- **Modern Interface**: Responsive and intuitive design
- **Comparative Analysis**: Visualize different implementations and approaches
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, step-by-step navigation

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **React 19** - User interface
- **TypeScript** - Static typing
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **CSS3** - Modern styling
- **ESLint** - Code quality

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd engineer-lab

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Select a Concept**: Choose from available engineering concepts and data structures
2. **Control Playback**: Use play/pause buttons or navigate manually
3. **Observe Visualizations**: Watch real-time changes and interactions
4. **Learn**: Understand how each concept works through interactive demonstrations
